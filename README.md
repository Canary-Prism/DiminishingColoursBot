# DiminishingColoursBot

this is a bot that gave me headaches a lot  
the bot makes it so you can specify exactly what colour you want, but if you're approaching the role limit it'll start averaging colours together  
honestly though the "allocating" part of the bot i already forgor how i made it.  
#### today feels like a dream
