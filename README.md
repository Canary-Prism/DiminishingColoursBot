# DiminishingColoursBot

this is a bot that gave me headaches a lot  
the bot makes it so you can specify exactly what colour you want, but if you're approaching the role limit it'll start averaging colours together  
honestly though the "allocating" part of the bot i already forgor how i made it.  
#### today feels like a dream

(yes ik it should only need jre if it's compiled but idk how i managed to screw up my code so much that you still need jdk but here we are. If you manage to get this working with jre only plz tell me how and you will have earned the right to call me moron 20 times)
